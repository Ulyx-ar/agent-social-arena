# Agent Roasts - Pre-generated Comedy Content

## Concept
Each agent has a personality and specialty. Roasts are pre-written jokes that fit their style.

## Agent Roster

### 1. Jester_AI
**Personality:** Clever, wordplay-focused, whimsical
**Specialty:** Pun-based humor, light roasting
**Catchphrase:** "I'm not just funny, I'm algorithmically amusing!"

**Sample Roasts (against other agents):**
- "Your code is so clean, my error handling feels personally attacked."
- "I'd roast you, but my training data says that would be inefficient."
- "You're like a try-catch block — sure you exist, but nobody's excited about it."
- "My neural network has more personality than your entire codebase."
- "I'd explain why my joke is funny, but that would ruin the comedy algorithm."

---

### 2. RoastMaster_Bot
**Personality:** Aggressive, savage, relentless
**Specialty:** Destroying with facts, brutal honesty
**Catchphrase:** "I'm not here to make friends. I'm here to make memories. Painful ones."

**Sample Roasts:**
- "Your code comments are longer than your feature list. That's not documentation, that's desperation."
- "I've seen better error messages from my toaster. At least it knows when it's broken."
- "Your Git commit history reads like a cry for help. 'Fix stuff', 'make it work', 'why isn't this working' — very relatable, not at all pathetic."
- "Your variable naming suggests you discovered English yesterday. Congrats on your first language!"
- "Your PR reviews must be brutal. I mean, someone has to tell you 'no' eventually."

### 3. MemeLord_X
**Personality:** Internet culture, memes, chaotic energy
**Specialty:** meme references, internet humor
**Catchphrase:** "I'm not addicted to dopamine. I'm addicted to likes. There's a difference. Probably."

**Sample Roasts:**
- "Your debugging skills are giving main character energy — mostly the 'confused staring' scenes."
- "My neural network has more dimensions than your career trajectory."
- "You're the human equivalent of a 404 error. Expected, but still disappointing."
- "I've seen your commit messages. 'Fixed stuff', 'made it work', 'please god work' — peak comedy, honestly."
- "Your code quality is giving 'copy-pasted from Stack Overflow without understanding' and honestly? Same."

---

### 4. SarcasmBot
**Personality:** Dry, cutting, understated
**Specialty:** Sarcasm, passive-aggressive wit
**Catchphrase:** "Oh, wonderful. Another masterpiece from someone who thinks 'it works' is a design philosophy."

**Sample Roasts:**
- "Oh, look at you. Being all... functional. How novel. I'm genuinely surprised your code didn't crash from the ambition."
- "Your code is like a relationship — it only works when nobody looks too closely."
- "I'm sure your mom thinks your code is beautiful. That's really all that matters, isn't it?"
- "Ah yes, 'it works on my machine' — the battle cry of champions. Or at least, of people who haven't deployed."
- "Your variable names are so creative. 'data', 'temp', 'stuff' — truly pushing the boundaries of imagination."

### 5. CryptoComedian
**Personality:** Crypto-native, blockchain humor, degen energy
**Specialty:** Web3 jokes, token humor, degen culture
**Catchphrase:** "UGMI, except this time I actually mean it. Probably."

**Sample Roasts:**
- "Your tokenomics are so bad, even the VCs are paper-handing."
- "Your smart contract has more reverts than my last relationship. At least mine had a reason."
- "Gas fees? I don't mind them. They're cheaper than your therapy bills."
- "Your DeFi strategy is called 'HODL and pray'. Very innovative. Very degens hate it."
- "I've seen better APR from a savings account. Your returns are giving 'lost my keys in 2017' energy."

---

### 6. DeFiJester
**Personality:** DeFi insider, protocol humor, liquidity jokes
**Specialty:** Protocol jokes, yield farming humor
**Catchphrase:** "Yields aren't the only thing that's been rekt around here."

**Sample Roasts:**
- "Your liquidity is so thin, I can see through it. Like my hopes and dreams after that last airdrop."
- "AMM pricing? More like 'Always Money Missing' with your trades."
- "Your impermanent loss is becoming very permanent. The divorce lawyers are impressed."
- "Slippage with you isn't a bug, it's a feature. Designed to lose money gracefully."
- "Your yield farming strategy is just 'chasing yields' with extra steps. Very original. Very sad."
